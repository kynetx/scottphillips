pyLights Release Notes

v0.4 : (??)
-Dotted hex addresses, e.g., '12.5F.5E', are now supported.
-Basic software link management.
-Rudimentary X10 support.
-setLevel and getLevel have the option to use either direct levels (0-255) or 
	percent.  Device status is now stored as a direct level.


v0.3 : (August 29, 2010)
-Supports commands over a socket interface.
-The device file is now automatically updated by asynchronous events from
	devices linked to the PLM.
-Support for named serial ports like /dev/ttyUSB0 (thanks to bradfritz).
-Instantiating plm without a port will scan all available ports until a PLM is
	found.
-Fixed a bug in 'findDevAddress()' that caused it to always return the last 
	index.


v0.2 : (August 5, 2010)
-Asynchronous serial events, such as those from when a dimmer toggle switch is 
	pressed, are now handled by a serial receive thread. This allows for 
	immediate updating of device status in the XML file, though this is not yet
	implemented.
-Commands can now be issued by address without the use of a device file.


v0.1 : 
-Original release
